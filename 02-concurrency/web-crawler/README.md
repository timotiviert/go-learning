# Exercise: Web Crawler

In this exercise you'll use Go's concurrency features to parallelize a web crawler.

Modify the `Crawl` function to fetch URLs in parallel without fetching the same URL twice.

_Hint_: you can keep a cache of the URLs that have been fetched on a map, but maps alone are not safe for concurrent use!
